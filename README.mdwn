# generatepicons.py -- Generator for @ocram's picons

This script generates @ocram's picons from the source images that are available
at <https://github.com/ocram/picons>. The resulting picons are as close to
the [originals](http://ocram.github.com/picons/) as possible.

## Why?

Because I wanted to produce the final versions of some of the TV channel logos
I was developing before pushing the changes to @ocram. The script he uses to
produce is original picons [is not available](https://github.com/ocram/picons/pull/60#issuecomment-10409548)
so I wrote my own.

## Dependencies

* [Python 2.x](http://python.org)
* [pgmagick](http://bitbucket.org/hhatto/pgmagick)
* [python-progressbar](http://code.google.com/p/python-progressbar/)

On Debian/Ubuntu based operating systems these can be installed by
installing the packages

    python-pgmagick python-progressbar

## Downloading

generatepicons home page is at
<http://solitudo.net/software/misc/generatepicons/> and it can be downloaded
by cloning the public Git repository at `git://scm.solitudo.net/generatepicons.git`.
Gitweb interface is available at
<http://scm.solitudo.net/gitweb/public/generatepicons.git>.

Also available at [Github](https://github.com): <https://github.com/tjormola/generatepicons>

## Installation

Just install the dependencies, clone the Git repo and put `generatepicons.py`
anywhere you want (or run directly from the cloned working directory).

## Usage

Run

    /path/to/generatepicons.py --help

for full command line help.

Typical use case to generate all the picons and symlinks for them would be

    git clone git://github.com/ocram/picons.git
    cd picons
    /path/to/generatepicons.py
    for dir in ocram-picons/*; do sh picons.sh $dir; done

and under `ocram-picons` you would find subdirectories that
contain the ready stuff.

During the execution of the script you might see a lot of lines like this in
the terminal:

    gx=0.321210, gy=0.597870, bx=0.155890, by=0.066040
    wx=0.345750, wy=0.358550, rx=0.648500, ry=0.330880
    gx=0.321210, gy=0.597870, bx=0.155890, by=0.066040
    wx=0.345760, wy=0.358580, rx=0.648450, ry=0.330860

This is caused by warning `printf`'s in an older versions of
[libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/). It's harmless though annoying.

## Thanks

Thanks to @ocram for initiating his [TV channel logo project](http://ocram.github.com/picons/)
and [sharing some info](https://github.com/ocram/picons/pull/60#issuecomment-10479427)
how his script works so I was able to replicate the results of the original as
closely as possible.

Also thanks to @tkurbad for his [piconlinks.py](https://github.com/tkurbad/piconscripts).
Some of the bulk code (args parsing, main function) was shamelessly stolen from
his script. This is my first public Python script, after all :)
